# Evaluations on hand pose estimation with RGB 
[我的博客](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_32896115)  
## Description
This project provides codes to evaluate performances of hand pose estimation on several public RGB datasets, including RHD, Dexter+Object, Stereo hand pose dataset. We collect predicted labels of some prior work which are available online and visualize the performances.
## Datasets
* **Stereo hand pose dataset (SHD)** 
provides frames of 12 stereo video sequenceseachrecordingasinglepersonperformingvarious gestures [66]. It contains total 36,000 frames. Among them, 30,000 frames sampled from 10 videos constitute a training set while the remaining 6,000 frames (from 2 videos) are used for testing.

* **The rendered hand pose dataset (RHD)**  
contains 43,986 synthetically generated images showing 20 differentcharactersperforming39actionswhere41,258images are provided for training while the remaining 2,728 frames are reserved for testing [68]. Both datasets are recorded under varying backgrounds and lighting conditions and they are provided with the ground-truth 2D and 3D skeleton positions of 21 keypoints (1 for palm and 4 for each ﬁnger), on which the accuracy is measured. 
* **The Dexter+Object dataset (DO)** 
contains 3,145 video frames sampled from 6 video sequences recording a single person interacting with an object

## Evaluation metric
There are two types of evaluation metrics that are widely used for hand pose estimation:
* **3D PCK & AUC :** the percentage of correct keypoints of which the Euclidean error distance is below a threshold
* **EPE：** mean end-point-error
